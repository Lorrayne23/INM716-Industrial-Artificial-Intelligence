# LAVU : Where your dreams of personalized luxury come true!


## Introduction

LAVU is based on the concept of combining traditional products with trends consumed by this generation. One of the main allies in applying uniqueness is the use of technology, especially generative Artificial Intelligence, which is being used to enable the creation of limited edition products for the luxury industry with art.

## Production and outputs

### Project 1( Burberry T-hirts and Maisons `a Horta)

LAVU’s first project aims to combine Burberry t-shirts with Picasso’s famous painting Mais-
ons `a Horta, since t-shirts are a primary item chosen by many people on a daily basis.


### Project 2(Chanel Bag and Starry Night Over the Rhˆone)
We decided to use Chanel handbags for our second customisation project
implementing collected information. Chanel, one of the most recognisable and well known
luxury fashion brands in the world, is very popular among current generations for its classic
product designs and craftsmanship.

### Project 3 (Chanel Perfumes and Takashi Murakami)

For the third product assignment at LAVU, we discovered that
Chanel’s fragrance and cosmetics division alone brought in USD 6.5 billion in revenue in
FY24 according to Forbes. Therefore we have decided to design Chanel perfume bottles which
carry a distinctive design principle, in order to give customers their favorite perfume bottles
redesign with fun and lovable art style.

### Project 4 (Chanel Perfumes and Takashi Murakami)

LAVU’s fourth product explores Dior’s skincare lines and Tarsila do Amaral’s painting, titled
“Postcard.”We strongly support a multi-plural environment to pursue big
dreams, and considering that our exploration was defined with Tarsila do Amaral, a Brazilian
painter and Latin American modernist.
